Text summarization is a significant task in natural language processing (NLP) that aims to generate concise and coherent summaries from larger texts. Various datasets are available to help train and evaluate summarization algorithms, each with its own characteristics and use cases.
Text summarization is a crucial aspect of natural language processing (NLP) that involves creating a shorter version of a text while retaining its essential information. Summarization techniques can be categorized into two main types: extractive and abstractive.

Data Preprocessing Steps

In this project, we performed several data preprocessing steps to prepare our data for training machine learning models. Below is an overview of the preprocessing pipeline:

1.Data Cleaning Task:

Identify and address any issues or inconsistencies in the raw data.

Steps:

Handle missing values:Check for missing values in the dataset and decide on an appropriate strategy for dealing with them (e.g., imputation or removal).

Remove duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate entries in the dataset to ensure data integrity.

Handle outliers: Identify outliers and decide on an appropriate approach for handling them (e.g., removing or transforming outliers).


2.Text Preprocessing (NLP Specific) Task:

Prepare textual data for NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or sequence-to-sequence modeling.

Steps:

Convert text to lowercase: Convert all text data to lowercase to standardize case and reduce vocabulary size.

Remove punctuation: Remove any punctuation marks from the text as they may not contribute to the task at hand.

Tokenization: Split the text into individual tokens (words or subwords) to prepare for further processing.

Stemming or Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form to normalize the vocabulary and improve model performance.
