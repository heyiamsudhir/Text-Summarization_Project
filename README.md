Text summarization is a significant task in natural language processing (NLP) that aims to generate concise and coherent summaries from larger texts. Various datasets are available to help train and evaluate summarization algorithms, each with its own characteristics and use cases.
Text summarization is a crucial aspect of natural language processing (NLP) that involves creating a shorter version of a text while retaining its essential information. Summarization techniques can be categorized into two main types: extractive and abstractive.

Data Preprocessing Steps

In this project, we performed several data preprocessing steps to prepare our data for training machine learning models. Below is an overview of the preprocessing pipeline:

1.Data Cleaning Task:

Identify and address any issues or inconsistencies in the raw data.

Steps:

Handle missing values:Check for missing values in the dataset and decide on an appropriate strategy for dealing with them (e.g., imputation or removal).

Remove duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate entries in the dataset to ensure data integrity.

Handle outliers: Identify outliers and decide on an appropriate approach for handling them (e.g., removing or transforming outliers).
